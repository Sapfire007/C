/*
    In a Smart Library System, each book has a unique numeric code printed on it. When a book is returned, the system calculates the sum of all digits in the bookâ€™s code.
    If the sum of digits is even, the book is placed in the East Section.
    If the sum of digits is odd, the book is placed in the West Section.

    Write a program to:
    Read the book code as input.
    Calculate the sum of its digits.
    Determine and display the section where the book should be placed.
    
    Input Example:
    34561
    Output Example:
    West Section
